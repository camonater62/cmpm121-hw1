## Scene Description
This scene is a mountain top radio station with a police chase. The kinds of objects included are largely nature objects to decorate the mountain along with cars and roads. I was initially inspired to make a night time drift scene, but I found that it would be better to wait until I have more knowledge on lighting to do that scene. The main character is the police car chasing the two red cars.
